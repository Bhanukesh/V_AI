# Restaurant Demo Data Seeder ðŸŒ±

This tool generates realistic demo data for the restaurant performance management system.

## Features

### Generated Data
- **5 Demo Restaurants** with different characteristics:
  - The Golden Fork (High-end, dinner only)
  - Bella Vista Italian (Mid-high range, lunch & dinner)
  - Harbor Grill (Upscale seafood, seasonal patterns)
  - Spice Route (Ethnic cuisine, high variability)
  - The Corner Bistro (Neighborhood spot, all-day)

### Data Volume
- **1 Year** of revenue data (365 records per restaurant = 1,825 total)
- **Hourly metrics** for operational data (~50,000+ metric values)
- **Smart correlations** between metrics and revenue
- **Realistic patterns**: weekends, seasons, rush hours

### Metrics Generated
- `prep_time`: 8-15 minutes (kitchen efficiency)
- `table_turnover`: 45-105 minutes (dining duration)
- `order_accuracy`: 85-99% (order correctness)
- `customer_satisfaction`: 2.0-5.0 rating (customer experience)
- `wait_time`: 5-25 minutes (service speed)

### Realistic Patterns
- **Weekend Boost**: 10-40% higher revenue Fri/Sat
- **Seasonal Trends**: December +30%, Jan/Feb -30%
- **Rush Hour Impact**: Higher prep times, lower satisfaction during 12-2pm and 6-8pm
- **Performance Correlation**: Better restaurants have faster service and higher satisfaction

## Usage

### Command Line Seeding
